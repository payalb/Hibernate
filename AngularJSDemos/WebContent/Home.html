	AngularJS routes enable you to create different URLs for different
	content in your application. Having different URLs for different
	content enables the user to bookmark URLs to specific content, and send
	those URLs to friends etc. In AngularJS each such bookmarkable URL is
	called a <i>route</i>.
</p>

<p>
	AngularJS routes enables you to show different content depending on
	what route is chosen. A route is specified in the URL after the
	<code>#</code>
	sign. Thus, the following URL's all point to the same AngularJS
	application, but each point to different routes:
</p>

<pre>
    http://myangularjsapp.com/index.html#books
    http://myangularjsapp.com/index.html#albums
    http://myangularjsapp.com/index.html#games
    http://myangularjsapp.com/index.html#apps
</pre>

<p>
	When the browser loads these links, the same AngularJS application will
	be loaded (located at
	<code>http://myangularjsapp.com/index.html</code>
	), but AngularJS will look at the route (the part of the URL after the
	<code>#</code>
	) and decide what HTML template to show.
