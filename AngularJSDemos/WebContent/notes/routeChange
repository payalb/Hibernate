Routing: diff url for diff content

need ng-view to display content

need ngRoute module as dependency and include angular-route.min.js in scripts

use config for setting diff controllers for diff urls.

Template given preference over templateUrl. Both don't work together.

When route changes, 4 events are triggered:
$routeChangeStart
$locationChangeStart
$locationChangeSuccess
$routeChangeSuccess


$scope.$on("$routeChangeStart",function(event, next, current){
	if(!confirm("You sure you want to navigate to "+next.$$route.originalPath){
	event.preventDefault();
	}
});

to reload route:
$scope.reloadData= function(){
			alert($scope.homeMessage);
			$route.reload();
		
	}
