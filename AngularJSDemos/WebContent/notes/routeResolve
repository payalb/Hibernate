If we don't want the page to be loaded until full route is resolved, use this resolve property which takes object literal 
whose value is a function. The resolve property can have one or more promises that must resolve before transitioning to new route. 
The property names can then be injected into the controller , so the controller doesn't have to fetch the data.

this is said to be conditional routing. If function returns value, then routed to new location. Prevents page from diirectly being routed when we hit url.

	resolve: {
					homeMessage: function($http){
						var url="http://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1/sites/wtmpeachtest.wordpress.com/posts?callback=JSON_CALLBACK";
						return  $http.jsonp( url).success(function(json) {
							return json.found;
						});
					}
				}
