Configuring states:

State means a place in angularjs application. To configure it, use state() method of $stateProvider.

$stateProvider.state("home",{
url: "/home",
templateUrl: "Template/home",
controller: "homeController",
controllerAs: "homeCtrl"});

Instead of href use ui-sref attribute. ui-sref stands for state, not url. url used to create url for it. If url not provided, no url change
<a ui-sref="home">Home</a>

With ui-router parameters are optional by default, so we don't hv to place a ? after them.

For caseinsensitive match, inject $urlMatcherFactoryProvider service into config function and call caseInsensitive(true) function.

default route: inject $urlRouterProvider service into config function and use otherwise() function.

To add custom data to a state in angular:
use data property of the state which takes in javascript object


html5Mode:same as ngRoute. 
$locationProvider service.
Since using ui-sref: no # symbols present.
base href present

nested states:

.state("student",{
}).state("studentDetails",{
parent: "student";
})

OR

.state("student",{
}).state("student.studentDetails",{

})

In parent state,  set abstract to true, data available to all child states.
