	div: to divide webpage into group of logical sections
	span: like div, but span is inside an html element like in a paragraph, whereas div can have various elements inside it.
	
	a:hover: pseudo-class: operates like a class. state of a link. Reach one state at a time.
	
	positioning elements: block, inline.
	h1, h2, para, div are block elements. Applies line break too. Takes all the space from left to right. Can apply width to shrink it's width.
Can place block element inside other block element.

img, span are inline. Will lie side-by-side. inline elements don't hv margin . img acts as a block that has margin all around. but span don't have margins on bottom, top. has only on sides.	

by applying display:block to inline element, it will behave as a block.browser automatically places a margin b/w inline elements. To center the images, use:
margin-left:auto;
margin-right: auto;
for block elements only.

we can use float to make block element behave as inline. div{
float:left;
width:50%;}


absolute positioning: 

position: absolute
top: 70px;
left: 40px;

Does not respect border/ boundaries of other elements if absolute positioning.

to make position fixed: use position: fixed. the element will not move even if browser resized.

position: relative... 


overflow: scroll/ hidden/ inherit;
width: 80px;


cursor: default/ inherit/ auto/ url/ crosshair/ pointer/ move, text, help, hand, no-drop, alias, progress, wait, grab, grabbing, copy, cell, spinning, none.


custom cursor: *.ico
custom:url("mail.ico"), default


wrap text around images:
img class="image"

img{
float: left;
margin-right: 10px;

}


static positioning: default, in flow
relative positioning: position determined by first static element. relative to static elements around it. top, bottom, left, right. All elements are static: body, p. So if we mention absolute positioning only, it is wrt. the browser. 
absolute positioning: position determined by first non-static element. If we give relative positioning to an element, it is no longer static. 


Navigation bar:
To get rid of dots present in the list format: ul{ list-style-type: none; padding:0; margin:0}
To remove underline for anchor tags: ul li a {text-decoration: none; font-family: georgia, "times new roman", times, serif; background-color: gray; color:white}
anchor tag is inline element. so to stretch background color: display: block; width: 80px; margin: 5px to have space b/w list elements.

height should be equal to line-height to center the text vertically. vertical-align:middle

ul li a:hover{

}

horizontal menus:
div id="nav"


li{
display:inline}


buttons:
<li><a class=button href="">Home</a></li>
.button{
box-sizing: border-box;}
