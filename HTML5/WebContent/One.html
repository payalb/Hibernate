Declaring a language is important for accessibility applications (screen readers) and search engines.The HTML lang attribute is used to identify the language of text content on the web. This information helps search engines return language specific results, and it is also used by screen readers that switch language profiles to provide the correct accent and pronunciation.<b> <u>en-gb for british english</u></b>

<h1 title="Heading">Biggest heading</h1>
<em>Title</em> attribute value would be displayed when we hover over the element.The alt Attribute

The <i>alt</i> attribute specifies an alternative text to be used, when an image cannot be displayed.

The value of the attribute can be read by screen readers. This way, someone "listening" to the webpage, e.g. a blind person, can "hear" the element.
The HTML5 standard does not require quotes around attribute values. Some may not work without quotes for eg. if the attribute value has a space.
<hr>
The &lt;hr&gt; tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.

The  &lt;hr&gt; element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:

<h6>Smallest heading</h6>
<p>This is a paragraph1.
</p>
<a href="#">Link1</a>
<a href="#">Link2</a>
<img src="" alt=image1>
a and img are both inline elements
<br>
Empty HTML Elements

HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.

&lt;br&gt; is an empty element without a closing tag (the &lt;br&gt; tag defines a line break).

Empty elements can be "closed" in the opening tag like this: &lt;br/&gt;.

HTML5 does not require empty elements to be closed.
<b>HTML tags are not case sensitive: </b> &lt;P&gt; means the same as &lt;p&gt;
