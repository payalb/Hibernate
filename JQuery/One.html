<p title="tooltip">This is paragraph one. One can add title to the paragraph to be displayed
as a tooltip to the user. It would be displayed when the user hovers over it.</p>
<hr>
The hr tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.

<hr>
The HTML 'pre' element defines preformatted text.

The text inside a 'pre' element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:

<pre>
 <b> My Bonnie lies over the ocean.</b>

 <strong> My Bonnie lies over the sea.</strong>

 <em> My Bonnie lies over the ocean.</em>

 <mark> Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.</mark>
