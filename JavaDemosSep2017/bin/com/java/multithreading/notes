Multithreading:
2 or more parts executing concurrently.Each program is called a thread.
Single program executing more than 1 task at a time.
eg: Text editor can also format the text while we are writing.

Create thread by: 
1) Extend the thread class:Override the run method
Thread class has the start and the run method. 
Create the thread object. It just creates the java object
Call the start method.
Start thread creates the new thread and executes the run method.
If you call the run method directly, new thread won't get created.

2) Implement the Runnable interface:
Runnable interface has only run method.
To create a new thread, has to wrap it inside the thread class and 
call the start method
